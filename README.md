# Diabetes Prediction with Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict diabetes using linear regression. The entire analysis and model development were conducted in a Jupyter notebook using Python.

## Project Structure

- `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Python Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes dataset, which is included in the `scikit-learn` library. It contains 10 physiological variables (features) and a target variable that represents a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

## Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries and modules.
2. **Load Dataset**: Load the Diabetes dataset from `scikit-learn`.
3. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand the features and target variable.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.
    - Handle missing values (if any)
    - Feature scaling
    - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
5. **Model Development**: Develop a linear regression model using the training data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).
7. **Visualization**: Visualize the results to interpret the model's performance.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository or download the `diabetes-prediction-linel-regression.ipynb` file.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `diabetes-prediction-linel-regression.ipynb` file and open it.
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and see the results.

## Results

The linear regression model provides a prediction for diabetes progression based on the input features. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression for predicting diabetes progression. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide, from data exploration and preprocessing to model development and evaluation.

## Future Work

Possible extensions of this project could include:

- Experimenting with different regression algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Including more advanced feature engineering techniques
- Evaluating the model on different datasets
